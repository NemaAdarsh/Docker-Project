# Project

-> To create a client and a server
-> Server: 
    - Scrape Data from TARGET_URL in server.py file and save it csv file
    - Count the number of words present in saved data
    - Share the data (csv file) to client (using volume mount)
-> Client: 
    - Client reads data from shared-data of server using mount in only read-only fashion
    - Note: Client should not be able to modify the csv file and only read it

# Commands and Tasks:

### Task1 : Build the client image, no changes required in client side EXCEPT for Task5 (below)

docker build -t client-image .

### Task2 : Complete the DockerFile before building the image, Fill the <complete> parts in DockerFile
2. in server folder

### Task4 : Run the right `docker run` commmand to read data from the server container, should be able to ONLY read the data from the volume
